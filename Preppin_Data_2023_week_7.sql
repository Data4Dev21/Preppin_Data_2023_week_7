/*For the Transaction Path table:
Make sure field naming convention matches the other tables
i.e. instead of Account_From it should be Account From
For the Account Information table:
Make sure there are no null values in the Account Holder ID
Ensure there is one row per Account Holder ID
Joint accounts will have 2 Account Holders, we want a row for each of them
For the Account Holders table:
Make sure the phone numbers start with 07
Bring the tables together
Filter out cancelled transactions 
Filter to transactions greater than Â£1,000 in value 
Filter out Platinum accounts*/
